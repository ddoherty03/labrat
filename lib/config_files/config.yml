# Sample user-level config file for the installing user.

# These settings correspond to the default values for all the options.  To
# change the default for you, uncomment a setting and set it to your desired
# default.  You can override these with command-line flags, such as
# --page-width=44mm.

# Any option that takes a dimension can use pt, mm, cm, dm, m, in, ft, or yd.
# A dimension without a unit attached designates Adobe points, i.e., 1/72in.

# The following describe the size of the labels to be printed indirectly by
# describing the size of the page on which they are printed, the page margins,
# the number of rows and columns, and the size of the gap between rows and
# columns, and the orientation of printing within each grid.  Each label is
# printed within a grid element resulting from the foregoing.  These defaults
# are based on a Dymo file folder label, which prints only one per page and is
# printed in landscape.

# page-width:  24mm
# page-height: 87mm
# left-page-margin: 5mm
# right-page-margin: 5.mm
# top-page-margin: 0mm
# bottom-page-margin: 0.mm
# rows: 1
# columns: 1
# row-gap: 0mm
# column-gap: 0mm
# landscape: true

# Rather than setting the above attribytes in an ad-hoc manner, it is probably
# better to define a label name in the labeldb.yml file (either in the user
# config directory ~/.config/labrat/labeldb.yml or in the system config
# directory /etc/xdg/labrat/labeldb.yml) and then just specify a label name
# here or on the command-line.  The name of a label with its dimensions to be
# used by default.

# For example, this is a defined label type and the its dimensions are the
# default for labrat.
#
# label: dymo30327

# Each of the following deal with formatting at the label level.  What you see
# is the default.

# These can be one of (1) left, (2) right, or (3) center.  They determine the
# alignment of the label text within a label.
#
# h-align: center
# v-align: center

# Dimensions for the padding within each label.
#
# left-pad: 4.5mm
# right-pad: 4.5mm
# top-pad:  0mm
# bottom-pad: 0mm

# On a multi-label page of labels, you may want to start printing in a label
# slot other than the first, e.g., if you are printing on a partially-used
# sheet.  The labels are numbered left to right, top to bottom, starting with
# 1.
#
# start-label: 1

# The name of the font to use to print the text of the label.
#
# font_name: Helvetica
# The font style can be one of (1) normal, (2) bold, (3) italic, or (4)
# bold-italic.
#
# font-style: normal
# The size of the font to use.
#
# font-size: 12pt

# These dimensions should normally be left at zero, but are here to make up
# for defects in printer drivers that fail to print a pdf exactly as it is
# shown in a pdf previewer.  They nudge the final label text left or right
# (delta_x) or up or down (delta_y) to compensate for any such defects.
#
# delta-x:  0
# delta-y: 0

# A file from which to read label texts, one per blank-line separated
# paragraph.  A value of null here means no input file, and it would be
# unusual to define one in the configuration file, but if you wanted to you
# could put the path name here and labrat will perform ~ expansion on it.
# Relative paths are relative to the directory from which labrat is run.
#
# file: null

# A string sequence that is interpreted as a line-break can be defined.  Such
# a sequence is particularly helpful when you provide the label text on the
# command-line, though it will be applied to file-read label texts as well.
# nlsep: '++'

# The name of the printer to use in substituting for the %p placeholder in the
# print-command setting below.
#
# printer: 'dymo'

# The file to write the pdf on.  It is used in substituting for the %o
# placeholder in the print-command and view-command settings below.
#
# out-file: labrat.pdf

# These are the commands for printing and viewing the out-file.  The
# view-command is something you may want to change, depending on your
# preferences, though qpdfview is quite good in that it provides a tabbed view
# and allows a unique instance to be dedicated to labrat with the --unique and
# --instance flags.
#
# print-command: lpr -P %p %o
# view-command: qpdfview --unique --instance labrat %o

# The following correspond to the -V, -T, and -v flags respectively.
#
# view: false
# template: false
# verbose: false
