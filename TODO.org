1. Include aliases for labels in the db, or perhaps allow one label command to
   include another label command, provided infinite recursion does not occur.
   Perhaps check depth of reference?
2. Include a --list command to list all known label types.
3. Include verbose diagnostics for each phase of label production: read
   configs (say which were found), read labeldb (say where found), read
   command-line arguments (echo those found), echo non-opts argument.
