* Introduction
This gem provides a command-line application, ~labrat~, for the easy printing
of labels after suitable configuration.  It also provides Emacs and ~vim~
libraries for easily invoking ~labrat~ from within the editor to make a label
from the paragraph at point.

It can handle everything from label printers such as the Dymo LabelWriter
geared toward single label printing to full-size printers for printing a
series of labels on label sheets from Avery or other suppliers of label
sheets.  It includes a library of pre-configured settings for around 250 label
products, and provides a convenient way to define new ones or variations on
the pre-configured ones.

It also provides aids to configuring new labels such as printing page grids based
on label definitions to refine new label definitions.

Easy-to-print labels can make the process of creating file folders trivial,
but there are many other uses for them, such as badges and marking cables, electrical
panels, ports, and outlets.

* Motivation
I need to print labels. And in my case, mostly I need file folder labels.  I
typically want to print to a Dymo LabelWriter, of which I own several
variants.  The problem is that I work almost entirely in Linux, but the simple
task of printing a file folder label has required opening a GUI application,
such as the very fine [[https://help.gnome.org/users/glabels/stable/][glabels]], or worse, switching to a machine running
Windows or to a Mac to run Dymo's proprietary GUI.  The Dymo GUI is
particularly irksome because it takes a long time to start up and demands that
you register every time you open it.

* Quick Start
That's too much ceremony for generating simple labels.  I wanted a way to
print a file label from the command line, or even better, from within my
editor, Emacs.  After giving up looking for such a thing without success, I
decided to write my own.  Hence labrat.  With it---after due
configuration---printing a file folder label is as simple as:

#+begin_src sh
  $ labrat 'First Line of Label ~~ And the Second Line'
  #+end_src

Or, you can preview the label in your previewer of choice (mine is qpdfview)
by adding the -V flag:

#+begin_src sh
  $ labrat -V 'First Line of Label ~~ And the Second Line'
  #+end_src

* Installation
Since =labrat= is distributed as a Ruby gem, you have to have a ruby
installation.  Look [[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/][here]] for ruby installation instructions.  You can then
install =labrat= with:

#+begin_SRC sh
  $ gem install labrat
#+end_SRC

#+RESULTS:

After installation, you should install the user and system (if you have sudo
privileges) configuration files
with:

#+begin_SRC sh
  $ labrat-install
#+end_SRC

#+RESULTS:

This will, assuming you have sudo privileges, install an annotated system-wide
config file in =/etc/xdg/labrat/config.yml= and a system-wide label database
in =/etc/xdg/labrat/labeldb.yml=.

It will also install an annotated sample user config file in
=~/.config/labrat/labrat.yml= and a sample user-level label database in
=~/.config/labrat/labeldb.yml=.

If you invoke =labrat-install= multiple times, it will refuse to overwrite any
existing config or database files that you may have already installed.  If you
want to re-install them you have to remove the existing files or move them out
of the way.

* Editor Integration
** Emacs
Included with =labrat= is an elisp file (=labrat.el=) that will invoke
=labrat= to form a label with the text of the paragraph at or before point.
So within Emacs, you can bind keys to the commands, =labrat-print= and
=labrat-view= to print or view the current or prior paragraph as your default
label.  Thus, in Emacs, I have ~C-z C-l C-l~ bound to =labrat-print= and ~C-z
C-l C-v~ to =labrat-view=, and I can type a label in any buffer and get it
generated with very little ceremony.

** Vim
There is also a vim plugin that you can copy to you =~.vim/plugins/labrat.vim=
directory to invoke ~labrat~ from within ~vim~.  Suggested keybindings are
included for copying to =~/.vim/after/plugin/labrat.vim= that bind
=<leader>lp= and =<leader>lv= to invoke ~labrat~ in normal and visual modes.

** Installing the Libraries
After running ~labrat-install~ both the emacs and vim libraries will be copied
to =~/.config/labrat=. It's up to you to copy them from there to you Emacs
load-path or vim ~plugin~ and ~after/plugin~ directories respectively.

Or, you can just add symlinks to the distributed files, so you get updates
whenever you update ~labrat~:

For emacs:
#+begin_src sh
  $ cd ~/.emacs.d/lisp  # Assuming this is on your load-path
  $ ln -s ~/.config/labrat/labrat.el labrat.el
#+end_src

Then, `require 'labrat'` in you Emacs init file.

And for vim:
#+begin_src sh
  $ cd ~/.vim/plugin
  $ ln -s ~/.config/labrat/vim/plugin/labrat.vim labrat.vim

  $ cd ~/.vim/after/plugin
  $ ln -s ~/.config/labrat/vim/after/plugin/labrat.vim labrat.vim
#+end_src

* A Tip on Buying File Folder Labels
As mentioned, one of my main motivations for writing =labrat= was the need to
easily create file-folder labels.  I got into creating files after reading
/Getting Things Done/ by David Allen.  One of his recommendations for keeping
organized is having a filing system so that documents can be easily archived
and retrieved.

I have long used Dymo's 30327 label, which is just the right size for file
folders.  But after several years of use, I started to notice something
alarming: I could no longer read the text of the labels, they had nearly faded
into oblivion.  The problem is that the labels use a thermal printing
technology that is affected by light and time, and over a period of years,
they get lighter and lighter.  You may have seen the same thing on old
thermal-printed store receipts.

After looking for alternative printers, I found the solution, not in a new
printer technology, but in a new label technology.  DuraReady makes labels
that can be printed on a thermal printer like the Dymo LabelWriter, but print
on a "Gloss white polypropylene BOPP plastic."  I'm not sure what that is, but
the labels come out with nice black lettering on a white background, and they
don't fade.  Check it out here: [[https://www.duraready.com/file-folder-labels/1034d-9/16-x-3-7/16-white-bopp-plastic-label/][DuraReady]].

Thermal labels may be fine for ephemeral applications like name tags or
shipping labels, but are terrible for long-term applications like file
folders, marking cables, marking electrical breakers, or any other number of
applications where long-term readability is essential.

* Usage
=labrat= is a linux command-line program for quickly printing labels.  It uses
the [[https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn][Prawn gem]] to generate PDF files with label formatting in mind. With
=labrat= properly configured, printing a label is as simple as:

#+begin_example
$ labrat 'Income Taxes 2021 ~~ Example Maker, Inc.'
#+end_example

And you will get a two-line file-folder label printed that looks like this:

[[./img/sample.png]]

Note that an outline was added to make the size of the label apparent and is
not actually printed with the label by default.

** Setting options
You can control how =labrat= composes a label completely from the
command-line, though that would be a very tedious thing to have to do.
Better, set up your preferred configuration in your user config file, so that
all you need to supply on the command line is the text of the label.  Every
command-line option has an equivalent configuration option using the long form
of the option as a key in a YAML configuration format.

Labrat reads options from the following locations, with the locations listed
from lowest to highest priority.  In other words, options set in the
first-listed location can be overriden by settings in later-listed locations.

1. From =/etc/xdg/labrat/config.yml=.  This is a YAML formatted file in which
   the long form of the option, without the leading '--', is used as a key
   with the setting as the value.
2. From =~/.config/labrat/config.yml=.  It also uses the YAML format based on
   the long form of option names.
3. Finally, it reads options from the command-line, where, of course, the
   leading hyphens are mandatory.

** Dimensions and other values in options
Many of the options deal with specifying some sort of distance.  Those are
designated with the placeholder ~DIM~.  A ~DIM~ is an integer or floating
point number followed by an optional unit of measurement.  If no unit is
given, the unit ~pt~ for "points" are assumed.  Here are the valid units that
you can use:

- ~pt~ :: Points, or Adobe points, or "big points", equal to exactly 1/72 of
  an inch, the default if no unit is given
- ~mm~ :: Millimeters,
- ~cm~ :: Centimeters, equal to 10 millimeters,
- ~dm~ :: Decimeters, equal to 10 centimeters,
- ~in~ :: Inches,
- ~ft~ :: Feet, equal to 12 inches,
- ~yd~ :: Yard, equal to 3 feet.

Most other options are strings, which need to be quoted on the command-line if
they contain any spaces or other characters special to your shell.  In the
configuration files, string values need not be quoted.

** Page Setup Options
~Labrat~ can handle multi-label pages such as Avery-style label sheets.  These
options deal with the page-level dimensions of the, potentially, multi-label
page.  By contrast, the dimensions of individual labels are dealt with by the
label setup options described in the [[* Label Setup Options][next]] section.

*** Orientation
- ~-L~, ~--[no-]landscape~ :: Orient the label grid and the printing direction
  of the text of the label in landscape (default false), i.e., with the label
  grid rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise so that the first label is printed
  down the page starting at the upper right element of the grid.  This setting
  does not affect what is left, right, top, or bottom for purposes of
  specifying the page dimensions, but does affect what is considered
  "horizontal rows" and "vertical columns": those are counted in the rotated
  direction of printing.
- ~-P~, ~--[no-]portrait~ :: This is simply a convenience switch meaning
  ~--no-landscape~ and is the default.

*** Page Dimensions
When specifying page dimensions, =labrat= regards all dimension-related
directions, left, right, top, bottom to refer to the page as is comes out of
the printer, unaffected by whether the labels are printed in landscape or
portrait.  This hopefully eliminates some confusion in the use of those terms.
Even a specialty label printer, such as the Dymo LabelWriter series, in which
the long skinny labels come out of the printer sideways, regard the page
dimensions in the orientation that the labels come out: that is, the "page"
has a relatively narrow width compared to its tall height.

With that in mind, specifying the page dimensions is just a matter of getting
out a ruler and measuring.

- ~-w~, ~--page-width=DIM~ :: Horizontal dimension of a page of labels as it
  comes out of the printer
- ~-h~, ~--page-height=DIM~ :: Vertical dimension of a page of labels as it
  comes out of the printer
- ~--top-page-margin=DIM~ :: Distance from top side of page (in portrait) to
  the print area
- ~--bottom-page-margin=DIM~ :: Distance from bottom side of page (in
  portrait) to the print area
- ~--left-page-margin=DIM~ :: Distance from left side of page (in portrait) to
  the print area
- ~--right-page-margin=DIM~ :: Distance from right side of page (in portrait)
  to the print area
- ~--v-page-margin=DIM~ :: Distance from top and bottom sides of page (in
  portrait) to the print area; short for ~--top-page-margin~ and
  ~--bottom-page-margin~
- ~--h-page-margin=DIM~ :: Distance from left and right sides of page (in
  portrait) to the print area; short for ~--left-page-margin~ and
  ~--right-page-margin~
- ~--page-margin=DIM~ :: Distance from all sides of page (in portrait) to the
  print area; short for ~--top-page-margin~, ~--bottom-page-margin~,
  ~--left-page-margin~ and ~--right-page-margin~

*** Page Grid
By default, =labrat= considers a page of labels to contain only one row and
one column, that is, a single label per page.  To set up a multi-label page,
you have to describe the number of rows and columns and the amount of the gap
between them.  The number of "rows" is counted as the number of "horizontal"
sets of labels after taking the page orientation into account.  Likewise, the
number of columns is counted as the number of "vertical" sets of labels after
taking the page orientation into account

- ~-R~, ~--rows=NUM~ :: The number of horizontal rows of labels on a page, taking
  into account the direction of printing via the ~--landscape~ switch.
- ~-C~, ~--columns=NUM~ :: The number of vertical columns of labels on a page,
  taking into account the direction of printing via the ~--landscape~ switch.
- ~--row-gap=DIM~ :: The distance between rows of labels on a page
- ~--column-gap=DIM~ :: The distance between columns of labels on a page

** Label Setup Options
These options determine the layout of individual labels within the page grid
rather than the page grid as a whole.  Note that the dimensions of a single
whole label is not specified, but is implicitly determined by:

1. the page width and height,
2. the page margins
3. the number of rows and columns per page, and
4. the row and column gaps.

The remaining space on the page is divided into a grid of identically-sized
labels, which determines the size of each label.

*** Padding
Within each label, the following options allow you to set the margins on each
side of the label:

- ~--top-pad=DIM~ :: Distance from top side of label to the printed text
- ~--bottom-pad=DIM~ :: Distance from bottom side of label to the printed text
- ~--left-pad=DIM~ :: Distance from left side of label to the printed text
- ~--right-pad=DIM~ :: Distance from right side of label to the printed text
- ~--v-pad=DIM~ :: Short for ~--top-pad=DIM~ and ~--bottom-pad=DIM~
- ~--h-pad=DIM~ :: Short for ~--left-pad=DIM~ and ~--right-pad=DIM~
- ~--pad=DIM~ :: Short for ~--top-pad=DIM~, ~--bottom-pad=DIM~, ~--left-pad=DIM~
  and ~--right-pad=DIM~

*** Alignment
By default the label text is centered horizontally and vertically within the
label, but the following options allow you to alter that.

- ~--h-align=[left|center|right|justify]~ :: Horizontal alignment of text
  within the label (default center);
- ~--v-align=[top|center|bottom]~ :: Vertical alignment of text within the
  label (default center)

*** Fonts and styling
=labrat= provides a few simple means for styling the label text.  Note that all
of these apply to the whole label text: there is no provision yet for doing
in-line changes of font styles.

- ~--font-name=[Times|Courier|Helvetica]~ :: Name of font to use.  Currently,
  these are the only three fonts are available: Times, Courier, or Helvetica.
  Without this option, Helvetica is used;
- ~--font-size=NUM~ :: Size of font to use in points (default 12)
- ~--font-style=[normal|bold|italic|bold-italic]~ :: Style of font to use for
  text (default normal)

*** Position Adjustment
Despite our best efforts, the vagaries of printer hardware, print drivers, and
cosmic rays, sometimes the text of the label is not positioned correctly
within the printable area of the label.  These options allow you to nudge the
print area a bit, left or right, up or down, to compensate for any such
anomalies.

- ~-x, --delta-x=DIM~ :: Left-right adjustment (positive moves right, negative
  left) of label text within the label print area.
- ~-y, --delta-y=DIM~ :: Up-down adjustment (positive moves up, negative
  down) of label text within the label print area.

** Job Processing Options
The following options control the processing of labels by =labrat=.

*** Starting label
When printing onto a multi-label page, some of the labels may have already
been used.  In that case, the ~--start-label~ option allows you to tell
=labrat= to start printing at some later label on the first page.  This option
has no impact on pages after the first.  The label positions are numbered from
1 up to the number of labels per page (i.e., rows times columns) from left to
right and down the page.  If you want to print a sheet that shows the label
numbers, see the ~-T~ template option below.

- ~-S NUM~, ~--start-label=NUM~ :: Start printing at label number NUM (starting
  at 1, left-to-right, top-to-bottom) within first page only.  Later pages
  always start at label 1.

This only affects the placement of the first label on the first page.  Any
later pages always start on the first label position.

*** New line marker
You can embed a special text-sequence in the label text to indicate where a
line-break should occur.  By default it is the sequence =∼∼=.  This means that
=labrat= will translate all occurrences of =∼∼= in the text into a line-break,
even consecutive occurrences.  There is no way to escape this in the text, so
if you want labels that use =∼∼= as part of the text, you are going to have
difficulty printing.  But you can change the marker to something else with
~--nl-sep~.  This is especially helpful when you are using the command-line to
supply the label text since specifying line-breaks on a shell command can be
difficult.  However note that this substitution takes place even when reading
label texts from a file or standard input.

- ~-n~, ~--nl-sep=SEPARATOR~ :: Specify text to be translated into a line-break
  (default ' =∼∼= ')

*** Label separator
The only way to print more than one label from the command-line is to indicate
where one label ends and the next begins with a special marker in the
command-line arguments, by default the string '@@'.  The text used for this
can be customized with this option.

- ~--label-sep=SEPARATOR~ :: Specify text that indicates the start of a new
  label (default '@@')

*** Number of copies
This option causes =labrat= to generate multiple copies of each label with all
the copies printed sequentially on the page.

- ~-c NUM~, ~--copies=NUM~ :: Number of copies of each label to generate.

*** Input and output files
**** Output file
By default, =labrat= generates all the labels into a PDF file located in the
directory $XDG_DATA_HOME/labrat, which is =~/.local/share/labrat~= by default.
The file's base name is time-stamped based on the time of the run. So, the
file name might look like =~/.local/share/labrat/2025-12-26T04:23:32.324.pdf=.
~Labrat~ will never delete these files, so you might want to perform cleanup
on this directory if disk space is precious.

You can specify a different output file with the ~--out-file~ option.

- ~-o~, ~--out-file=FILENAME~ :: Put generated label in the given file

Unless the =FILENAME= includes a directory, the file will be placed in the
current directory.  If you specify a directory that you do not have write
permission on, =labrat= will raise an error and exit.

**** Command-line arguments
By default, =labrat= gets the text of the label from the non-option arguments
on the command-line.  It combines all the non-option arguments and joins them
with a space between each argument.  For example,

#+begin_example
$ labrat -c3 This is a 'single label' ' ~~ composed of all this' text --font-style=italic
#+end_example

prints three copies of a single label in italics with two lines, breaking at
the ' ~~ ' marker, resulting in something like this:

#+begin_example
This is a single label
composed of all this text
#+end_example

Note that when the label text is specified on the command-line, ~labrat~ just
prints a single label.  The only ways to get multiple labels is by (1) marking
a separation between labels with the ~--label-sep~ marker ('@@' by default)
or (2) using the ~-c~ (~--copies~) argument to get multiple copies of the
label text.  These options can be combined as well.  For example,

#+begin_example
$ labrat -c3 This is the 'first label' @@ 'And the rest  ~~  is the second' text --font-style=italic
#+end_example

will produce three copies of two separate labels:

#+begin_example
This is a the first label

This is a the first label

This is a the first label

And the rest
is the second

And the rest
is the second

And the rest
is the second
#+end_example

**** Specified input file
Rather than get the text from the non-option arguments on the command line,
you can use the ~--in-file~ option to specify that label texts are to be read
from the given file instead.

Each paragraph in the file constitutes a separate label.  Line breaks within
the paragraphs are respected, though the ~--nl-sep~ marker is still replaced
with additional line breaks.  Any line starting with a ~#~ character is
considered a comment and is not included in the text of any label.

- ~-f~, ~--in-file=FILENAME~ :: Read labels from given file instead of
  command-line

**** Standard input
Only if there are no non-option arguments and no ~in-file~ specified, =labrat=
acts as a filter and reads the label texts from standard input in same manner
as for a specified ~in-file~, treating each paragraph as a label text and
disregarding comments.

**** Template exception
Notwithstanding all of the above, if the ~-T~ (~--template~) option is given
(see below at [[* Aids to testing label layouts]]), all label texts from the
command-line, an ~in-file~, or standard input are ignored and a template is
generated.

*** Printing or viewing
By default, =labrat= prints the generated output file to the printer named
with the ~--printer~ option using the shell command specified in the
~--print-command~ option.  But with the ~--view~ option, it will use the shell
command from ~--view-command~ to view the generated PDF file instead.

- ~-V~, ~--[no-]view~ :: View rather than print

*** Printing and viewing shell commands
By default, =labrat= uses the shell command:
#+begin_example
lpr -P %p %o
#+end_example
to print, and substitutes '%p' with the printer name and '%o' with the output
file name.  But you can specify a different print command with the
~--print-command~ option.  The printer name used in the substitution is by
default taken from the environment variable =LABRAT_PRINTER= if it is defined,
or from the environment variable =PRINTER= if it is defined and
=LABRAT_PRINTER= is not defined.  If neither is defined, it defaults to the
name 'dymo'.  But you can set the printer name with the ~--printer~ option in
any event.

- ~-p~, ~--printer=NAME~ :: Name of the label printer to print on
- ~-%~, ~--print-command=PRINTCMD~ :: Command to use for printing with %p for
  printer name; %o for label file name (the `%` is meant to remind you of a
  piece of a paper beingg fed between two rollers)

Likewise, =labrat= uses the shell command
#+begin_example
  qpdfview --unique --instance labrat %o'
#+end_example
to launch the previewer when the ~--view~ or ~-V~ options are given.  It also
'%o' with the output file name, but does not recognize '%p' as special.  It is
very likely that you will want to configure this with the ~--view-command~
option to your liking.

- ~-:~, ~--view-command=VIEWCMD~ :: Command to use for viewing with %o for
  label file name (the `:` is meant to remind you of a pair of eyes looking at
  the purdy label)

*** Aids to testing label layouts

**** Page Grid
The following options are very useful if your are trying to configure the set
up for a new label type or otherwise trying to figure out a problem, such as
setting the ~--delta-x~ or ~--delta-y~ values for your setup.

Normally, =labrat= does not print an outline for the labels, but if you are
testing things out on plain paper, it helps to know where =labrat= thinks the
boundaries of the labels are.  The ~--grid~ or ~-g~ options provide this.

- ~-g~, ~--[no-]grid~ :: Add grid lines to output

**** Page Template
When trying to define a new label layout, it also helps to just see what a
single sheet of labels would look like.  That is what the ~--template~ (or
~-T~) option gives you: it just prints an outline of where labels would be
printed and numbers the labels, but it ignores any label text.

- ~-T~, ~--[no-]template~ :: Print a template of a page of labels and ignore
  any content

**** Verbose Reporting
Finally, =labrat= will print a lot of information about what it's doing with
the ~--verbose~ or ~-v~ option.  The information is printed to the standard
error output stream.  This is particularly helpful in determining how the
final configuration was constructed from the various config files.

- ~-v~, ~--[no-]verbose~ :: Run verbosely, that is, print out lots of
  information about what =labrat= is doing as it processes the job.

** The Label Database and the label option
One of the nice things about =labrat= is that it comes with a database of
pre-defined label configurations for many standard labels, especially Avery
labels since they were good enough to publish PDF templates for all their
products at [[https://www.avery.com/templates]].

*** Listing labels
You can get =labrat= to list all the labels it knows about with
#+begin_example
$ labrat --list-labels
#+end_example

Any users who create useful label definitions can propose them for inclusion
with =labrat's= distributed label database by filing a pull request at this
git repository.

*** System label database
Here for example is the definition for Avery 8987 labels from the system
database:
#+begin_example
avery8987:
  page-width: 8.5in
  page-height: 11in
  rows: 10
  columns: 3
  top-page-margin: 15mm
  bottom-page-margin: 16mm
  left-page-margin: 10mm
  right-page-margin: 10mm
  row-gap: 6.3mm
  column-gap: 13mm
  landscape: false
#+end_example

Note that it restricts itself to page-level settings.  It would be
inappropriate to, for example, include something like ~font-style~ in a
system-wide label definition, though such things can be useful in a user's
private label configuration.

*** Trying out a label definition
You can see the result of this definition by using =labrat's= ~--template~ and
~--view~ options, like this:
#+begin_example
$ labrat -T -V --label=avery8987
#+end_example

And if you want to see it with sample label text filled in, try the following:
#+begin_example
$ labrat -V -c30 --label=avery8987 'Four score and seven years ago ~~ Our fathers brought forth'
#+end_example

*** Nesting label definitions
As it happens, Avery 8986 is laid out identically to Avery 8987, and the label
database makes an alias for it like this:
#+begin_example
avery8986:
  label: avery8987
#+end_example
In other words, it defines the ~avery8986~ label with a nested ~--label~
option that simply incorporates the ~avery8987~ entry settings.

*** Label database entries as configuration sets
This ability to use a label database definition as an alias for a whole set of
other configuration options allows you to add entries to your user-level label
database to collect useful sets of configuration settings under a name of your
choosing.  Here for example, are entries from my user-level database at
=~/.config/labrat/labeldb.yml= file that define the configuration for file
folders and badges:
#+begin_example
ff:
  label: duraready1034D
  font-style: bold
  font-size: 12pt
  delta-x: -3mm
  delta-y: 0.5mm

badge:
  label: avery18662
  font-style: bold
  font-size: 18pt
#+end_example

With this, you can print a file folder label with:
#+begin_example
$ labrat --label=ff 'Four score and seven years ago ~~ Our fathers brought forth'
#+end_example

And, if you want this to be your default label type, you can add to your user-level
config file, an entry like this:
#+begin_example
label:
  ff
#+end_example

Now you can print the label without the ~--label~ option on the command-line:
#+begin_example
$ labrat 'Four score and seven years ago ~~ Our fathers brought forth'
#+end_example

If you want to print badges, you have to specify the ~--label~ option explicitly on
the command-line:
#+begin_example
$ labrat -V -c14 --label=badge 'Daniel E. Doherty ~~ (Amateur Programmer)'
#+end_example

*** A Caution about option order
Note that =labrat= processes options from the system config file, the user
config file, and the command-line strictly in order so that later settings
override earlier settings.  For example, given the configuration above, where
~ff~ is your default label type, the following will not do what you expect:

#+begin_example
$ labrat --font-style=italic --label=ff 'Four score and seven years ago ~~ Our fathers brought forth'
#+end_example

You expect the label to be printed in italic, but the ~--label=ff~ option in
effect inserts all the settings for label type ~ff~ at that point in the
command-line, and thus overrides the ~--font-style~ setting with its own,
namely ~--font-style=bold~ from the user-level label database.

To get this to work, you have to put the command-line setting after the
~--label=ff~ option in order for it to take effect:
#+begin_example
$ labrat --label=ff --font-style=italic 'Four score and seven years ago ~~ Our fathers brought forth'
#+end_example
